# interview-test

Let's build something great ! 

This will be a nice and fun assignment to test your skills and allow continuance through the process;

## The app you'll be building: Pico y placa reminder app!!

### Objective:

Given the fact that car restriction based on license plates has changed, we would like to offer our clients
a really nice way to get a cool reminder on their phones about the days they are not allowed to use their cars.

Simply put, you'll be building that app yourself !! 

The requirements are as follows:

- 1. The app will have a very basic registration process (username / password)
- 2. The user can create and delete as many cars as they want.
- 3. Each car they save will have to save 3 simple values, make (brand eg. chevrolet, ford, suzuki, etc), color, licence plates.
- 4. For each license plate (last digit) the app will have to send a notification to the user on the day that they aren't allowed to use their car.
- 5. Lastly, they'll be able to logout out of the system.

### Rules:

There are no rules except, Have fun while doing it !!

### What we expect from you:

Creativity and originality are the most important thing here, you can use internet examples to guide yourself through the process. Although, we encourage our applicants to avoid submitting code that doesn't belong to them :( 

### How do I get started? 

1. Well, I guess you already have, if you are seeing this readme file, the chances are that you have alreadey *forked* this repo (if you don't know how to, there are some good guides online, as engineers we love reading them, give it a try !! ) 

> IMPORTANT: As this is a public repo, we don't want our main branches to recieve code from any of you, please do fork the repo and don't push anything against this one.

2. Once you have access to your own version of the repo, feel free to go wild, points are awarded as you use:

- nodeJS (Backend highly encouraged!! - but show us what you can do in other languages, we'll sure talk about it during the tech talk)
- React (Mandatory - As you can see I have already initialized the project for you, so take on!)

3. Create as many files as you need, sky is the limit!!

4. Git is crucial to us, so please refrain yourself from using or submitting your code via .zip / .rar archives.

- Q: Is testing needed? 
> A: It's highly encouraged as we do put TDD in practice, feel free to write as many tests as you want, we'll talk about it later ;) 

- Q: Is 2 days enough? 
> A: The role we're looking for should be able to develop these type of requiremnts, but as I mentioned above, we're opent to reviewing your code even if it's not finished yet!

- Q: What if I have more questions during development?
> A: As a web development company, we encourage our developers to ask even the most simplistic question you can think of, but during this interview process we won't be there to answer your questions, if they are related to design/business, please use your imagination, we are not looking for something in specific, you are your own company and we are your clients, show us what you can do :) 


Happy coding !!!
